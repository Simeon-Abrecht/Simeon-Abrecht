## Hi there, I'm Sim 👋

I’m passionate about working with **AI, machine learning, and data-driven systems**, with a particular interest in **LLM security and evaluation**.

- 🎓 My **Master’s thesis on large language model security**  
  → Project code:  
  [Evaluating the Defensive Capabilities and Reasoning Mechanisms of Open-Source Reasoning Models](https://github.com/Simeon-Abrecht/Evaluating-the-Defensive-Capabilities-and-Reasoning-Mechanisms-of-OpenSource-Reasoning-Models)

- 🛠️ I’ve also recently uploaded several other projects, including:
  - [NLP for Written Reviews](https://github.com/Simeon-Abrecht/NLP-for-written-reviews)
  - 📊 Interactive Dashboard *(coming soon)*
  - 🔍 More projects to be added

I’m always keen to learn, experiment, and work on problems at the intersection of **AI safety, applied ML, and real-world data**.
